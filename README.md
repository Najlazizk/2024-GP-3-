# Electech
The goal of our project is to revolutionize water heating systems by addressing the inefficiencies and energy wastage associated with conventional heaters, particularly in homes. By introducing a water heater with remote control functionality and electricity consumption monitoring, the project aims to significantly reduce electricity bills for users while improving comfort and convenience. Through remote control capabilities, users can efficiently manage their water heater, ensuring hot water is available only when needed, thus minimizing energy waste during idle periods. Additionally, the electricity consumption monitoring feature provides users with valuable insights into their energy usage patterns, empowering them to optimize electricity usage and conserve energy effectively. Overall, the project strives to optimize energy usage, lower electricity bills, and enhance user comfort, contributing to a more sustainable and cost-effective water heating solution.
